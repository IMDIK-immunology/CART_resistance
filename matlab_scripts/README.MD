# There are three scripts:

### :arrow_forward: [base_population_generator](https://github.com/IMDIK-immunology/CART_resistance/blob/main/matlab_scripts/base_population_generator.m) - to generate base population (initial population)
### :arrow_forward: [simulator](https://github.com/IMDIK-immunology/CART_resistance/blob/main/matlab_scripts/simulator.m) - to make actual simulations with the previously generated base population (to achieve a standardized starting point of simulation)
### :arrow_forward: [histogram_generator](https://github.com/IMDIK-immunology/CART_resistance/blob/main/matlab_scripts/histogram_generator.m) - to generate histograms based on the data from the simulation. The goal was to separate the simulation from its presentation
