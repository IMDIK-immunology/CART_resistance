# There are three scripts:

* base_population_generator - to generate base population (initial population)
* simulator - to make actual simulations with the previously generated base population (to achieve a standardized starting point of simulation)
* histogram_generator - to generate histograms based on the data from the simulation. The goal was to separate the simulation from its presentation
